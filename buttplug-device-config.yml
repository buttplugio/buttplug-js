# Welcome to Buttplug Device Config
#
# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE. YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN.
#
# Use user-device-config.yml for local device definitions.
#
# Now that we've got that bit of impoliteness out of the way... Hi,
# I'm qDot. Welcome to the buttplug device configuration file.
#
# You've managed to wander into this place we keep all of the sex toy
# information. You're not really supposed to be here, but since you've
# shown up, might as give you a tour.
#
# This file is used in all Buttplug reference implementations,
# including C#, JS, and whatever other languages we decide to
# implement things in. It's our main source of truth for devices we
# know about.
#
# Devices in Buttplug are defined in terms of their protocol. We group
# together all devices that speak the same language. It will look
# something like this:
#
# protocols:
#   lovense:
#     btle:
#       names:
#         - LVS-*
#       services:
#         0000fff0-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb: null
#
# The protocols portion of the config file lists all of the protocols
# we know, and how the devices that speak those protocols can be
# identified. For the above example, we're looking at Lovense brand
# hardware, all of which uses bluetooth LE, so we create a "btle"
# configuration section for that protocol. We list the device names
# (using a * as a wildcard, so this means "try to connect to anything
# that starts with LVS-"). We also list the services we're interested
# in. If a service only has rx/tx characteristics (many devices
# emulate serial in this way), we just put "null" and let the
# Bluetooth subtype manager sort out the characteristics on connect.
# Otherwise, if there are multiple characteristics, we list those in
# name/uuid form. See the definitions below for more examples.
#
# Other devices are similar. For USB/HID, we just list VID/PID pairs,
# as that's all we have to identify with.
#
# Serial ports are a bit different in that we don't have a specifier
# for them, they could be anywhere. Therefore, we just specify the
# port settings in this file. Baud rate, data bits, etc. In Buttplug
# Reference Servers, we allow the user to pass in another device
# config file like this one that they've built, that can define things
# like local port names. So the user may have a file that looks like:
#
# protocols:
#   erostek-et312:
#     serial:
#       ports:
#         - COM4
#
# The user's config will be merged with this config file in the
# server, which lets any Serial subtype manager know which port to
# discover the device on, as well as all of the other port settings to
# use.
#
# Users can also define things we're missing here, like new BTLE names
# or IDs we haven't gotten to yet. The only thing users can't define
# is new protocols, since those have to be implemented in source code.
#
# That's pretty much it for how this file works.


# Define identifier types. These are the only values devices can have
# in their connection-info lists.

connection-info-types:
  - btle
  - serial
  - usb
  - hid

# Things we may add some day: BT Classic, 433mhz radio
  
# Now for the actual protocol definitions. This is gonna get wild, so
# I'll keep a list of rules that you can refer to up here.
#
# - If you are curious about device identifiers or protocols, all
#   of those are documented at https://stpihkal.docs.buttplug.io
#
# - BTLE name fields can be wildcarded using "*". This allows us to do
#   things like searching for all devices of a certain name.
#
# - Where possible, we assume all devices have at least one output (so
#   we can send the commands), and maybe one input. In cases
#   otherwise, a comment should be left denoting what we're doing
#   something different.
#
# - Most toys just mirror good ol' serial. With that in mind, we call
#   the host-to-device line tx, and device-to-host line rx.
#
# - If you see a "btle" connection info with service IDs but no
#   characteristic IDs (null), this means that we'll try autodetecting
#   the characteristics. We'll just expect it to have an input (which
#   we'll name "rx") and an output characteristic (which we'll name
#   "tx"), as mentioned above.
#
# - Similarly for USB, we'll test endpoints for r/w flags when no
#   endpoint handles are passed. We assume all USB devices have a
#   vendor control endpoint for Trancevibrator reasons.
#
# - A "btle" connection info with multiple service listings can mean
#   one of two things. Either we expect the device to be identifiable
#   as multiple services (like Lovense), or the device may have
#   multiple services we use (like some BTLE toys that divide control
#   and sensor between different services).
#
# - If you're connecting to a buttplug server and don't see a device
#   that's listed here, it's not the fault of this config file.
#   Servers may not implement all protocols or busses for various
#   reasons. We just define which devices we may know about here. File
#   an issue on the library you're using.
#
# - If you're connecting to a buttplug server and some device doesn't
#   take a Buttplug message you're expecting it to, it's not the fault
#   of this config file. Servers implement protocols, and protocols
#   dictate which messages they are capable of sending. We don't
#   really keep a standard for that, we just define which devices we
#   may know about here. File an issue on the library you're using.
#
# - Serial info here is for default device configuration. Port names
#   will have to be added by the user in the user device config file.

protocols:
  
  lovense:
    # Lovense is special. Special in oh so many ways.
    #
    # Lovense have changed BLE name formats at least once. For this
    # generic device, we just use the largest wildcard we can. We do
    # our name and capabilities finding in the protocol
    # implementation, because we have to query the device after
    # connection.
    #
    # The service uuids change constantly. This list is overly
    # exhaustive, because we have to specify services in WebBluetooth
    # and can't wildcard them. We'll add more as we find them.
