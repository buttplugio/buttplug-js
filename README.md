buttplug-js is a core implementation in Typescript for the Buttplug
Sex Toy Control Protocol and Server Architecture. It contains the
classes needed to implement either Buttplug clients or servers.

The buttplug-js module is required for both web and node builds, but
only contains websocket connectors and bluetooth device management for
the web. If you want to build a buttplug application in native node,
check out the [Helper Libraries](#helper-libraries) section for more
node modules that will aid development.

**Note:** As long as this library is in the v0.x library phase, expect
API breaking changes at minor version (0.x) changes. Build version
(0.?.x) version changes should just be bug fixes or non API breaking
additions.

## Installation

### Node and NPM

To install buttplug-js in your node project via npm, a simple add call
should do it.

```
npm add buttplug
```

### Web CDN

As of version 0.4.0, the buttplug-js repo is also built as a browser
script via webpack, meaning you can just include it off a CDN and
start writing code!

```html
<html>
  <body>
    ...
    <script src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/buttplug@[version]/dist/web/buttplug.min.js'></script>
    <script type='text/javascript'>
      // Buttplug library is umd, exposed as:
      // - Global: Buttplug
      // - amd: buttplug-amd
      // - commonjs: buttplug-commonjs

      // Here's hoping we don't see w3c make a Buttplug spec and collide this.
      var bpclient = new Buttplug.Client("My very own buttplug web client");
      // Now go off and do clienty things.
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## API Documentation

buttplug-js API Documentation is available at
[https://metafetish.github.io/buttplug-js](https://metafetish.github.io/buttplug-js).

The documentation is rebuilt on every commit/merge to master.

We highly recommend reading through the Buttplug Protocol Spec to get
an idea of what messages are available. The Protocol Spec is available
at [https://metafetish.github.io/buttplug](https://metafetish.github.io/buttplug).

## Usage Example

An example of how a simple HTML/JS web app can use Buttplug-js is
available in the example directory, though you'll need to build the
project first. 

The example is also available for remix on
[Glitch](https://glitch.com) at
[https://how-to-buttplug.glitch.me/](https://how-to-buttplug.glitch.me/).

## Web Application Developer Tools

buttplug-js includes a set of developer tools for building web
applications, including a log viewer and a device simulator. These can
be accessed by loading the following script:

```html
<script src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/buttplug@[version]/dist/web/buttplug-devtools.min.js'></script>
```

For more information on using Buttplug DevTools, see our glitch tutorial at
[https://how-to-buttplug-devtools.glitch.me](https://how-to-buttplug-devtools.glitch.me).

## Buttplug and Uglify

When using Buttplug with an application that will uses Uglify for
compression and minifying, make sure to set the following options:

```javascript
uglifyOptions: {
  mangle: {
    keep_fnames: true,
    keep_classnames: true
  },
  compress: {
    keep_fnames: true,
    keep_classnames: true
  }
}
```

If keep_fnames and keep_classnames are not set, the compressor and
mangler will cause the buttplug message parser to throw errors. If you
get invalid message errors, this may be why.
