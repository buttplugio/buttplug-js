buttplug-js is a core implementation in Typescript for the Buttplug
Sex Toy Control Protocol and Server Architecture. It contains the
classes needed to implement either Buttplug clients or servers.

The buttplug-js module is required for both web and node builds, but
only contains websocket connectors and bluetooth device management for
the web. If you want to build a buttplug application in native node,
check out the [Helper Libraries](#helper-libraries) section for more
node modules that will aid development.

## Installation

### Node and NPM

To install buttplug-js in your node project via npm, a simple add call
should do it.

```
npm add buttplug
```

### Web CDN

As of version 0.4.0, the buttplug-js repo is also built as a browser
script via webpack, meaning you can just include it off a CDN and
start writing code!

```html
<html>
  <body>
    ...
    <script src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/buttplug@[version]/dist/web/buttplug.min.js'></script>
    <script type='text/javascript'>
      // Buttplug library is umd, exposed as:
      // - Global: Buttplug
      // - amd: buttplug-amd
      // - commonjs: buttplug-commonjs

      // Here's hoping we don't see w3c make a Buttplug spec and collide this.
      var bpclient = new Buttplug.Client("My very own buttplug web client");
      // Now go off and do clienty things.
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## API Documentation

buttplug-js API Documentation is available at
[https://metafetish.github.io/buttplug-js](https://metafetish.github.io/buttplug-js).

The documentation is rebuilt on every commit/merge to master.

We highly recommend reading through the Buttplug Protocol Spec to get
an idea of what messages are available. The Protocol Spec is available
at [https://metafetish.github.io/buttplug](https://metafetish.github.io/buttplug).

## Usage Example

An example of how a simple HTML/JS web app can use Buttplug-js is
available in the example directory, though you'll need to build the
project first. 

The example is also available for remix on
[Glitch](https://glitch.com) at
[https://how-to-buttplug.glitch.me/](https://how-to-buttplug.glitch.me/).

## Web Application Developer Tools

buttplug-js includes a set of developer tools for building web
applications, including a log viewer and a device simulator. These can
be accessed by loading the following script:

```html
    <script src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/buttplug@[version]/dist/web/buttplug-devtools.min.js'></script>
```

For more information on using Buttplug DevTools, see our glitch tutorial at
[https://how-to-buttplug-devtools.glitch.me](https://how-to-buttplug-devtools.glitch.me).

## Node Websocket Classes

buttplug-js includes modules for using native Node websockets.

### Server

The client class provided with this library derives from the
ButtplugServer class, and can be used as a standalone server.

```javascript
let Buttplug = require('buttplug');

let server = new Buttplug.ButtplugNodeWebsocketServer();

// Insecure hosting, on localhost:12345
server.StartInsecureServer()

// Secure hosting, on 192.168.1.2:6969
// Cert and Private should be paths to cert/private files
server.StartSecureServer("./cert.pem", "./private.pem", 6969, "192.168.1.2");

// ...
```

If you need to create a local secure server with self-signed
certificate (for instance, for accessing the server from a web app on
an https server), we recommend using the
[selfsigned](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selfsigned) package.

### Client (Connector)

The client class provided with this library implements the
IButtplugConnector interface, and needs to be passed to a
ButtplugClient class during connection.

```javascript
let Buttplug = require('buttplug');

// The connector takes the websocket URL to connect to, and a boolean
// to know whether to reject on cert fail if connecting via secure
// websockets.
//
// If you are connecting to a local server, there is a good chance 
// it will be using a self-signed cert. You will need to pass 'false'
// as the second argument so the cert if not rejected. If you will 
// only be connecting to servers with actual CA verifiable certs,
// pass 'true'.
let connector = 
  new Buttplug.ButtplugNodeWebsocketClientConnector("wss://localhost:12345/buttplug", false);

let bpc = new bp.ButtplugClient("test");
bpc.Connect(c);
// ...
```
